Different currents within Neuropsychology
- experimental				-> research to determine fundamental functions
- cognitive   				-> 
- clinical (and forensic)

Requirements for the animal model
- Process of sickness should also be available in human beings
- Origin is not always known (e.g. Alzheimer)
- Animal / human characteristics don't always overlap
- Animals don't have remote memory (memory of distant places / times)

Cognitive neuropsychology
- Development of models and processes about normal cognitive processes
- People with brain injry facilitate the testing of models and theories

Clinical neuropsychology
- Apply knowledge about the brain-behavior relationship of patiÃ«nts who've suffered cranial trauma.

Tasks of the neuropsychologist
- Diagnosis
- Neurorevalidation

Neurorevalidation
- Check what the implications for the functioning of the patient are
- What coping mechanisms are used
- Check what the psychosocial consequences are
- Is lost functionality truly restored?

Neuroscience & community
- Cranial trauma is ever increasing
- Increase in number of traffic victims (traumata)
- We're getting older (CVA, Dementia)
- Alcohol and drug abuse

Cerebral trauma
- Most occuring sub 40 
- Disturbed blood supply	-> Ischaemia
- Scar tissue           	-> Epilepsia

Traumatic brain injury (TBI)
- Open head injuries (e.g. gunshot)
- Closed head injuries (commotio, contusio)

Neuropathology of TBI
- White matter vulnerable because of tear and wear in axons
- Myeline decrease
- Disconnection effects
- Mild TBI 	-> conventional imaging, no WML
- DTI      	-> cingulum, fronto-temporo-occipital association fibers
- Heavy TBI	-> Subcortical white matter, corpus collasum, fornix, brain stem

Cerebro Vasculair Accident (CVA)
- Stroke	-> sudden interruption of blood flow
- Unblooded -> cerebral ischaemia
- Blooded   -> difference in clinical image
- Cerebral ischaemia 	-> thrombosis, embolism, cerebral arteriosclerosis, hippocampus vulnerability
- Cerebral hemorrhage	-> Hypertension, aneurysm

Infections in Central Nervous System (CNS)
- Can enter through ears, nose, throat
- Or through direct skull fracture
- Dangerous because hit glia cells die rapidly
- Can lead to: 
	-> Thrombosis: closing of blood vessels
	-> Interruption of oxygen and glucosis metabolism
	-> Change in conducticity of cell exterior 
	-> Pus increases brain pressure
	-> Odema: accumulation of fluid in tissue
- Infections
	-> Encyphelitis: caused by bacteria

Dementia
- Alzheimers             	-> plaques and tangles in the brain
- Frontotemporal Dementia	-> gradual decrease of frontal lobe tissue
- Vascular Dementia      	-> caused by problems in blood supply

Dynamic localization theorem
- Complex behavior cannnot be attributed to a single cerebral region 
- Complex functions are built out of components
- Leads to syndromes, not symptomes
- Balints syndrome: leasion bliateral occipotal, parietal, dorsal temporal
	-> dispersed visual attention
	-> simultane agnosion
	-> inability to track moving object
	-> abnormal visual search
